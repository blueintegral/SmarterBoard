Introduction:
============
SmarterBoard is a hack (and work in progress) that I wrote for MHacks, the largest hackathon ever.
It uses a camera mounted on top of a projector aimed at a white board and lets you write an equation
or expression on the white board and the answer will be projected in. It's basically a physical NUI for
Matlab. I wanted to explore a new paradigm of math where the computer is brought to the user rather than 
the user brought to the computer. 

So far, it captures an image of the white board and does OCR on the handwritten numbers to try to figure 
out what they are to do the calculations. This code isn't real pretty and there's still a lot of work that 
needs to be done.

Usage:
======
Run interact.m in Matlab.
